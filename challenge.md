 # What I learned

 Settting the blue box to 25% width will no make it 25% of the page.  It will be 25% of the parent element, the green box.  In order for the blue box to be 25% of the page, it will need to be 50% of its parent, and the parent is 50% of it's parent the red box, which is 100% of the page.
